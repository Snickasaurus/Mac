# Copy all scripts from Dropbox to FreeNAS

My Dropbox holds all scripts for Linux, Mac and Windows. And even though I trust Dropbox not to delete any of my shit I'm
still paranoid enough to keep them duplicated elsewhere.

The directory structure looks as follows: /Users/Me/Dropbox/Scripts and under that is what you see in the pic.

This script simply uses Rsync to mirror to my server.
